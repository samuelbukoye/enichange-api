# ENICHANGE-API

You can check out the site I used this api at [ENICHANGE](enichange.herokuapp.com)

It is a money exchange application

React, typescript, styled components \_frontend

Node, express, mongoose, mongodb, \_backend
You can create a random account with it and make different transactions

Basically you can send money to any registered user including yourself just by selecting the username

And then check the home page where it'll show all your transactions
